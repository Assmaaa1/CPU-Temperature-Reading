# CPU-Temperature-Reading

This programm allows to Read the temperature of the CPU and dispaly it using UART

A continous automatic conversion is enabled 

The clock frequency = 16 mhz generated by the internal FRC clock

The ADC clock frequency = Fpclk, Fpclk= Sysclk= 16 mhz

The build in 12-bit ADC is used during the test

Hardware : STM32F411E-DISCO
Software : Keil uvision , version 6

Note : A USB TO UART Adapter is used to connect the  Laptop to the UART peripheral of the board
