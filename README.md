# ADC-DRIVER
ADC DRIVER FOR STM32F411E-DISCO

This programm allows to measure the analog sigal applied to pin PA1 through a POT

The measured value is printed out in the watch terminal while debugging 

A continous automatic conversion is enabled 

The clock frequency = 16 mhz generated by the internal FRC clock

The ADC clock frequency = Fpclk, Fpclk= Sysclk= 16 mhz

The build in 12-bit ADC is used during the test

Hardware : STM32F411E-DISCO
Software : Keil uvision version 6
Programming Language : C
